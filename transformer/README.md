# Transformer

The Transformer architecture from "Attention Is All You Need" revolutionized NLP by replacing recurrent networks with self-attention mechanisms. This became the foundation for modern language models like GPT, BERT, and ChatGPT.

## Why Transformers Matter

**The Problem with RNNs/LSTMs/GRUs:**
- Sequential processing → slow training
- Vanishing gradients → poor long-range dependencies  
- Fixed memory bottleneck → limited context understanding

**The Transformer Solution:**
- Parallel processing → faster training
- Direct attention connections → better long-range modeling
- Dynamic attention → flexible context understanding

## Core Architecture

**Self-Attention:** Each word can attend to any other word in the sequence, allowing the model to understand relationships regardless of distance.

**Multi-Head Attention:** Multiple attention mechanisms run in parallel, each focusing on different types of relationships.

**Positional Encoding:** Since there's no recurrence, position information is added to embeddings to maintain sequence order.

**Feed-Forward Networks:** Each position gets processed through identical but independent neural networks.

**Layer Normalization + Residual Connections:** Stabilizes training and helps gradients flow through deep networks.

## Key Innovation

Instead of processing sequences step-by-step like RNNs, Transformers process entire sequences simultaneously while using attention to understand which parts are relevant to each other. This makes them both faster to train and better at understanding context.
