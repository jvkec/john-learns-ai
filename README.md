# AI Journey

This repo documents moments in my life where I decide to sit and learn why and how AI works the way it does.

## Why I am working on this

This repository serves as a learning laboratory. A place to experiment, make mistakes, document insights, and track my progress from AI user to someone who can confidently build and deploy AI systems while knowing what's going on under the hood. I hope to showcase my thoughts and any ideas I form along the way.
